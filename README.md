# Personal Website v3
My last 2 iterations focused on getting *something* deployed, but I tried to go "above and beyond" this time in terms of graphic design. Feel free to use my repo as a base for your own projects, but I'd appreciate if you credited me when doing so! On your website or the source repository is fine :)
