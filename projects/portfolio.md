This is actually the website you are reading right now (a la inception). As one might surmise, I wanted to make a website to showcase my past efforts and further my design capabilities - this netscape being the fruit of those efforts.
  * This page was written in React.js (using the next.js framework)
  * The styling was done in vanilla CSS from scratch - no templates or theming frameworks were used
  * Supports dynamic markdown rendering - in fact each project page is rendered directly from a markdown document.
