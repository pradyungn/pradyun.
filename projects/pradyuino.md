A not-so-clever portmanteau of my name and "arduino" - as that implies, this is an arduino schematic that I made and hand-wired myself.

Just like a normal arduino, this board is based on an ATMega328p. It runs off both a direct 5V DC power supply, or you can supply a DC current that will be accordingly stepped down to 5V.

You can see images of the finished product by clicking on the image button in the bottom right (image gallery in progress). This project is special to me - it was the first time that most of the work I put in was optimizing something (in this case the space footprint) rather than learning a new technology and testing its potential.

As of June 2022, I'm revisiting this project to learn computerized PCB design :)
