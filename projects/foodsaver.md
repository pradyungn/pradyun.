My first Hackathon project ever! I made this in 2018 at SMHacks II, in which we got runner up. The premise of the project was to mitigate food waste by finding recipes that people could make using the leftover food in their fridge. Furthermore, the application accounted for what recipes you used, and would suggest recipes to use whatever food you had leftover. By the end of the hackathon, the focus of the application had shifted to suggesting recipes to people based on what they had in their fridge.

* We used HTML/CSS for the front end, without any libraries or CSS templates
* The backend was written in Java with a SpringBoot framework
* To improve per-user experience, we wrote a rudimentary login API using Python and SQLite
